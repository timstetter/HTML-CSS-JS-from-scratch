  <h1>Tim Stetter</h1>
  <p><em><strong>Software Developer</strong> and Coffee Enthusiast</em></p>

  <p>
    I have been technologically curious since the day my father’s 14.4k modem
    dialed up Prodigy. I am now charting a new path towards becoming a Full Stack Software Developer.
    I have an extensive background in technical support and am growing my
    skills at Grand Circus learning Java, Git, MVC, JPA/Hibernate, SQL and
    how to use APIs to build a web application. I’m excited to continue learning
    new skills and technologies and apply them on the job everyday. I grew up
    in Michigan and have lived in Grand Rapids and downtown Detroit.
    I attended RIT in Rochester, NY but now call Auburn Hills home...for now.
